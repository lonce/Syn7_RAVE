# Overview

This is a max patch that uses a RAVE model trained on 7 audio textures (from https//syntex.sonicthings.org).  It uses the IRCAM nn~ object to wrap the model. The model plays sound files (a few from the original dataset are included), in real time while providing access to a means of manipulating the stream of 4 latent vectors produced by the RAVE encoder.
